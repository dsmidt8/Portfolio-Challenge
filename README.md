# Week 2 Challenge - Portfolio
.

## Challenge:

```
Using CSS and HTML, build a website that displays developer's portfolio.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section


WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Process:

To make this website I started with building the framework in HTML. 

I started working on the header first. 

After looking at some other websites I liked the look of having the header and navigation in the hero. I then deleted the header and included the header elements in the hero.

I then worked on the content. The about me contains the profile picture and a short desctiption. As of 5/8/2022 the description is short with more to be added at a later date.

The Applications section contains stock images of websites due to me not having any of my own websites yet. They contain anchors to hold links to future websites, but there are no links due to not having my own websites.

The contact me contains my email and phone number as list elements.


The CSS element includes the styling for the page. A lot of this styling was created using trial and error to increase my abilites with the CSS language. 

Using media queries, when the screen is resized elements change from a horizontal view to a verticle style.
